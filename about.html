        <section class="about-text">
            <p>Saumon's Cookies was founded in 1902 by a French-American baker named Simone Saumon,
            who was lured to the Pacific Northwest by the quality of the salmon in the region.</p>
            
            <p>Simone set up a small shop in Portland, OR and got to work. Using only the freshest ingredients available, 
            they began to make a number of different baked goods, incorporating the local salmon into every recipe.</p>

            <p>These unique cookies and pastries tapped into a new market, one that no one else had even 
            considered before. Who knew that combining fish and baked goods would be so popular? It was a 
            testament to Saumon's ingenuity and revolutionary forward-thinking that made Saumon's Cookies
            so popular. Saumon did not just disrupt baking; they invented a whole new kind of baked good.</p>

            <p>Since then, Saumon's Cookies has flourished, expanding to five locations in Portland. Future plans include
            opening a cafe, the Cafe Saumonella, at the Pearl location by 2020.</p>
