                    <p>Savory and sweet, grab a neat treat down the street at Fish in Cup! Love you some fish? Try some of this ish! Salmon cookies and coffee, who would have thought? None other than Pat 'Pattycakes' McGee from Seattle! An unlikely combination that bore the fruit of unlikely success, Fish in a Cup has been keepin' the Pacific Northwest salty and caffeinated for over 5 years now and great news is you don't have to die to try; just head on over for a dip and sip!</p>
