One fish, Two fish, Red fish, Blue fish,<br>
Black fish, Blue fish, Old fish, New fish.<br>
This one has a little car.<br>
This one has a little star.<br>
Say! What a lot of fish there are.<br>


<!-- 
Yes. Some are red, and some are blue.<br>
Some are old and some are new.<br>
Some are sad, and some are glad,<br>
And some are very, very bad.<br>
Why are they sad and glad and bad?<br>
I do not know, go ask your dad.<br>
Some are thin, and some are fat.<br>
The fat one has a yellow hat.<br>
From there to here,<br>
From here to there,<br>
Funny things are everywhere.<br>
Here are some who like to run.<br>
They run for fun in the hot, hot sun.<br>
Oh me! Oh my! Oh me! oh my!<br>
What a lot of funny things go by.<br>
Some have two feet and some have four.<br>
Some have six feet and some have more.<br>
Where do they come from? I can't say.<br>
But I bet they have come a long, long way.<br>
we see them come, we see them go.<br>
Some are fast. Some are slow.<br>
Some are high. Some are low.<br>
Not one of them is like another.<br>
Don't ask us why, go ask your mother.<br> -->
