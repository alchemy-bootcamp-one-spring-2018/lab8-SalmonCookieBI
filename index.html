            <h2>Beginnings</h2>
                <p>The Salmon Cookie Co. began in Seattle after Pat, the founder, had the great idea of combining two signature Seattle icons, salmon and coffee, which turned into a super successful business.
                Pat developed a recipe for a coffee-time confection called Salmon Cookies. His shops are doing so well in Seattle that he wanted to expand to Portland.</p>

                <p>The cookies are made into the shape of a salmon, and are actually made with salmon (though the fish is ground up so fine that you can't even taste it!). They are the ideal match for a steaming cup of coffee on a PNW morning. 
                Or PNW afternoon... whatever. Portland tourists will go gaga for them, locals will begrudgingly fall in love with them!</p>
