    <h1>Salmon Cookies</h1>

    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>From the earliest days of the Northwest, people have been enjoying the benefits of eating Salmon. In more recent times, our area has become known for its delicious cookies. <strong>Finally, we have brought the two together!</strong></p>
    <p>Introducing <span class="brand-name">Salmon Cookies</span> - a nutritious and delicious treat combining the great tastes of salmon and freshly baked cookies into one unique Northwest delicacy.
    </p>
    <p>Our bakers start early each morning, visiting the fish market to select only the sweetest and tastiest salmon from each day's catch. Then, the fish is prepared and finely-ground to be used as the base for our variety of cookie flavors - follow your nose to one of our always-busy locations today!
