            <p>Welcome to Saumon's Cookies. We're a bakery in Portland with a local twist: all of our
            baked goods use salmon in them. We mix both sweet and savory cookies, muffins, croissants,
            and other assorted pastries with the meaty yet mild taste of salmon.</p>
            <p>The local bounty of salmon in the Pacific Northwest region makes this marriage of sweet and savory
            a no-brainer. And, of course, we practice sustainability and eco-friendly policies in the making of our
            baked goods - it's the very least we can do.</p>
            <p>Drop by one of our five <a href="locations.html">locations</a> in the Portland metro area and ask for a sample.</p>
            <h1 id="home-promise">We think you're going to love it.</h1>
